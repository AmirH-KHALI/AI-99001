# Artificial Intelligence Course Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the projects of [Artificial Intelligence course](http://sauleh.github.io/ai99) at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST).

## P0: Unix/Python/Autograder Tutorial

This project is a tutorial on how to use Unix commands, Python programming, and autograding tools. It covers basic concepts such as variables, data structures, control flow, functions, classes, modules, and testing.

The original project description can be found here: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project0.html

## P1: Search

This project is about implementing search algorithms for an agent that navigates a maze world. It covers uninformed search methods such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and uniform-cost search; as well as informed search methods such as greedy search and A* search.

## P2: Multi-Agent Search

This project is about designing agents that can play games such as Pac-Man against adversarial opponents. It covers minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax algorithm, and evaluation functions.

The original project description can be found here: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project2.html

## P3: Reinforcement Learning

This project is about applying reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent that can play Pac-Man. It covers value iteration, Q-learning, epsilon-greedy exploration, approximate Q-learning, and feature extraction.
